# Session Three
##Dagoba Commons Tourney
*We begin this session with the party headed to the local shrine as a save point*

### The Shrine
> The smell of wet iron invades your senses as you enter the temple. A shrine to the Weavers imposes its stony gaze on you as you begin to feel a warmth rush into your soul as if you have found home again. The weavers sit upon an odd looking throne with its deep black crevices that run all over the thrones. They give you looks of satisfaction and kindness as you approach. 

>"Welcome to Dagoba. We see that you've been aquainted with the locals! Have you need of rest before the Tournament begins?"

The party can banter with the Weavers
> "Well, there is one quest that we do need doing. You see, for a long time, we have been plagued by one of the Benefactors of the tournament. His name is Jon Treznor. He is, to ourt knowledge, not a traveller, yet, is seemingly invincible. Year after year, he enters the travellers bracket and wins. We think that he may be a lich. Try to take him down and win the tournament!"
