# Session One
## The One With Consequences

*We begin with Zach back at The Crystal Lodge. Salem and Cherry, resting up after a hard fought battle with a small horde of goblins*

> The smell of smoked meat and eggs wafts down the hall as you awaken from your slumber

*As the adventurers wake, they  may hear a voice down the stairs [4OB WIL]*
> When the crow flies at midnight..

*There are a couple moments of silence while Brogon scopes the room for unknowing folks*

If Brogon sees or hears nobody, he responds with,
> The monsters are alight. Come, follow me.

If anybody sees this, they can follow Brogon into the secret tunnel he opened behind his bar to an underground marketplace where *The Black Tunnels* are located. *Must make an [4OB Dex] check to get past the cellar door as it closes directly behind the hooded figure*

If nobody hears the voice, they can go downstairs to see a sign that says, *"Ring bell for assistance, please"*

A few moments later, a large man with long, black hair, tied back appears. 
> " Name's Gugnir, how can I help you?"

> "Brogon says that breakfast is on him this morning. He does that on rare occasion. What a guy, he is. Oh, have you all heard? The Dagoba Commons Tourney is going on! The winner gets 1000 Kryo or 5000 drops of Ink and a weapon made by Firamar, the town blacksmith! If you are interested, the tournament grounds are just north of town. Dont worry, that area is blessed as well by the ink of our Patrons."

After breakfast, the party can go exploring the town or if they decide to enter the tournament, the entry fee is 10 drops of ink or 50 Kryo

### The Dagoba Commons Tournament
Every year, there is a tournament that is sponsored by `The Dagoba Alliance`, a group that not many know about but everybody is aware of. They are only known to the public as `Our Generous Benefactors`.

*The shine of steel and mithril penetrate your eyes as you walk through the door. Several hooded figures look your way wearily as you pass the wooden doorway. Cautiously, a man with an odd face tattoo about the left side of his face approches the counter. "You look a little lost. Can I help you?"*
