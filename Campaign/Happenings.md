# Happenings in Session Zero
## Zach
* Banned from Ted's General Store

*After a harrowing run in with Uril and almost succumbing to Uril's hammer, the party leaves for Dagoba in an unknowing world. They fight a couple bandits and some goblins to get to the next town. Their first night went without a hitch.*

*They arrive in Dagoba, battle-weary and in need of rest. Zach heads for a store in search of ink-letting gear and steals a magic crystal vial from Ted*
