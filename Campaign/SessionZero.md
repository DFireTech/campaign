### The One Where The Safe Haven Was Attacked

> A shadowy figure with a deep rumbling voice. Creatures of the mist at his beck and call. A Haven that many once called home, now in ruins. Citizens flee in all directions as they ran for their lives. You grabbed what you could
> as you tried to protect your Haven. A wisp of light above you foretells that this Haven has been forsaken by its current Weavers. You know of another Haven that is about a two days travel from here. Your party flees the carnage
> of Ashrest to head for Dagoba.

> Dagoba is a one of few Havens that has something to offer in this land of mist. To ward off the monsters, some travellers have opted to defend the city in one of its many towers and connecting bridges.
> For those in the know, this is a place of beauty and beasts. In the center of town, is a crystal clear pool of water that has been clear for a millenia. Many consider this to be the Good Omen of the Weavers
> and if the water turned sour, something terrible must have happened.

#### The Tavern
*The Crystal Lodge, a fine establishment of food, ale, and one of forgetting the dangers of the Mist*
> Standing before you is a short man with black, slicked back hair and wears a necklace in a shape unfamiliar to you. He can be seen helping guests or cleaning his glasses to a gleaming shine, when unoccupied. "Welcome to The Crystal Lodge, the finest drinking establishment in Dagoba. How may I help you?"  This is Brogan

*Asking the right questions or repeating the right phrase will get you some info on the black market. "When the crow flies at midnight.." "The monsters come alight.*
*Asking about the nearest Shrine will point you to the northern-most building in the haven.*


#### The Summoning
> Ahh yes, the Destined Ones. We have foreseen your arrival yet again! Although, not all is well here in Dagoba. You see, the local Goblin Warlord, Kark, has threatened our Shrines very existence. He has gone all over
> and recruited many of his kind and then some to seige our Haven. As you all know, our cities walls are becoming visible to the creatures of the Mist. They grow more powerful by the day. However, we have learned of a mystical
> spell that can heal our walls and make us invisible to them once again! Our vision showed a chest and many of those foul goblins around it. Go forth and find us this mystical scroll so we can once again hide from these foul beasts
> and protect our city from disaster!
