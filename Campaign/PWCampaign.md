# This Was Only The Beginning

*X children, born at the same time in the Haven of Dagoba. The Print Weaver was already in wait at their birth, as this was a momentous and unpreceented time*

*The Print Weaver gently grabs each players infant hands and records their precious fates by pressing their fingers into Ink and placing it on the papyrus*

* Each player will write down their finger print archetypes, read from left hand first, right hand second
* Stats and beginning gear is derived from this block of prints

# The Towers

*The Six Towers of the Mist hold secrets beyond what mere mortals can ever imagine. Nobody has ever gone to a tower and came out alive*
*That was until Uril, now known as Stalker of the Mist came out of a tower and declared himself King of the Mists. Many have challenged him, none survived.*





*You've all been sent by the Print Weavers to investigate the remaining towers and to see what secrets they hold. Hopefully, they hold an end to the mist and the pain that humanity has suffered for a millenia*
